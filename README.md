# services-market

Service discovery platform for small businesses.

# Setup

Installed Vendure backend using CLI : ```npx @vendure/create my-shop```

# Process

1. Added some custom fields to vendure-config for experimentation

2. Created custom Vendor plugin, for vendors(sm businesses owners) to capture custom data for intended features.

- ```npx vendure add``` command, and select "Create a new Vendure plugin".
  This will guide you through the creation of a new plugin and automate all aspects of the process.
  However i created plugins manually for better understanding/learning.
